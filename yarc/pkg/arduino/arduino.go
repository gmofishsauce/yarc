// Package arduino provides a synchronous byte I/O interface to an Arduino.
// The initial implementation uses the default USB serial port provided by
// an Arduino Nano. Opening a standard USB serial port activates the DTR signal
// which resets the Arduino, necessitating a full reconnect. The code in this
// package  is (necessarily) aware of this. A future version of the hardware
// may support a second serial connection that is USB at the host but Tx/Rx
// only at the Nano, allowing the host to reopen a connection without causing
// a reset. The code in this package will need to change when and if that
// hardware is implemented.

// Originally, the code in this file provided an _asynchronous_ interface
// to the Nano by using channels and select statements for read and write.
// When I ran Golang's data race detector, however, it fired, and the race(s)
// were in the serial port object itself - between port.Read() and port.Close(),
// for example. The Read() was by design a blocking read, meaning the Goroutine
// that issued the Read() spent all its time blocked there waiting for bytes to
// arrive from the Nano, putting them on the read channel, and then blocking
// again. So I couldn't just throw a mutex around the call; it would have been
// held all the time except for a moment each time a byte arrived. This would
// have deadlocked with the need to write on the port (since the Nano only
// responds to requests from the Mac). Bottom line, the serial port object
// isn't threadsafe and it's hard to work around it.
//
// Fortunately, when I discovered this, v1.4 of the of go.bug.st/serial.v1
// had appeared. It offers a read timeout. So it's no longer the case that
// all reads must block indefinitely. I ripped out the Goroutines and changed
// this code to do everything from the main thread (Goroutine). The struct
// arduino remains, holding just a single field (it used to have more).

// Naming this package was hard. The functionality is fairly general and could
// be used (or easily adapted for use) with serial devices other than Arduino.
// Also, it's only being tested with a single Arduino model (a Nano) so it's
// a bit of an overreach to assert that this is for "Arduino". But in the end
// it's the answer that provides the most clarity.
