# Microcode editor

The original microcode editor is in first.htm. It "works".

A prototype "improved" microcode editor is in ucode.{htm,js,css}. It's not ready.

## Usage

Open the `.htm` file directly in the browser. The page does not use the network and does not write any local state. As you set the controls, the text at the bottom of the screen changes. When you are satisfied, copy and paste that text into Arduino C code or yasm source code. Refresh the page to reset.
