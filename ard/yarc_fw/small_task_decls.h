/*
 * Log users have to implement a callback function that places a
 * messages in the buffer "bp" passed as an argument, staying within
 * the "count" passed as an argument. Where possible, the string
 * should be stored in ROM (PROGMEM). The following sample shows
 * the usual way of doing this.

  unsigned long i, j, k; // for example
  set i, j, k to something;
  int n = snprintf_P(bp, count, PSTR("message: %ld %ld %ld"), i, j, k);

 * snprintf_P returns "...the number of characters that would have been written to s if there were enough space."
 * http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__stdio.html#ga53ff61856759709eeceae10aaa10a0a3, so ...
 *
 * return (n > bcount) ? bcount : n;
